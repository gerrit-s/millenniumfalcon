RobotC Notes

##how auto mode works
for auto mode in comp there is a specific template that you are supposed to use that takes the the two main programs: auto mode and driver controll into one program. it can be found under the File > New... > Competition Template.

## git hub
git hub is a way to save programs and have a history its good because you can work on the same code on multiple computers and also if you mess up really bad you can go back to and earlier save.

## what does what
if i want to change auto mode then i work in "autonomous_includes.c"
if I want to map buttons to motors i use  "usercontrol_includes.c" 
if i want to adjust motor and sensor setup then i use "robotconfig.c"
